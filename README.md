# Sorting-techniques
## Program:
Implemented the â€œheapsort" algorithm as an application for binary heaps.<br>
In addition to heapsort, Implemented O( nlogn ) algorithms (Quicksort and Merge Sort),and then Implemented O(n2) algorithms (Insertion, selection and bubble sort).<br>
The running time performance of the algorithms, is compared against each other.<br>
To test Implementation and analyze the running time performance, dataset of random numbers is generated and the relationship between the execution time of the sorting algorithm versus the input size is calculated.
